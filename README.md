# Django_e-commerceWebsite
Ecommerce has become a way of life in India. Once used only by the tech savvy to buy things not available in the neighbourhood mall, it has now become ubiquitous, thanks to a surge in internet use, and some heavy duty advertizing by ecommerce bigwigs. In this tutorial I have tried to make my own e-commerce website with the help of django.

## NOTE:
The python files containing the backend code for e-commerce website is stored in shop directory. The cart directory is the main directory that stores the path to shop.

## Creating Template
The template has been created using BOOTSTRAP. Refer the Documentation of Bootstrap for the *css and *Js of template of your own choice.

## Django- Admin
It is the superuser which manages the whole e-commerce website. Django provides a very powerful admin config.
### Tip: The media can be directly added form admin site as well as from the terminal.
